# Hi, I'm Felix 👋

I'm a **Computer Science graduate (B.Sc.)** and soon-to-be **M.Sc. student** at the University of Stuttgart, currently working as a **PreMaster at Robert Bosch GmbH**.  
My main interests are **scientific computing**, **simulation development**, and **bridging theory with practical, industry-ready solutions**.

I enjoy working on:
- 🖥️ **High-performance simulations** (BEM, ray tracing, numerical methods)
- ⚙️ **C++ and Python development** for engineering applications
- 📊 **Data visualization** and simulation post-processing
- 🛠️ **Tooling & automation** for research and engineering workflows

## 📂 About my repositories
Most of my public repositories here were created during **school** and **university** — they reflect my learning journey and experimentation with different technologies.  
My **real-world, production-level contributions** are unfortunately stored in **corporate repositories** at Bosch and are **closed to the public**.  

If you're interested, I can **show selected examples privately** upon request.
